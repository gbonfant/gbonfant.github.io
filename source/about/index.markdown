Hi, I'm Gus. I'm a Software Engineer with an unusual interest in design, human behavior and human-computer interaction. With an almost obsessive need for devouring information I strive to be a quick learner.

I believe in fully dedicated oneself in order to achieve any level of success. You can view some of my [photos](//flickr.com/gbonfant), use my [code](//github.com/gbonfant), or follow me on twitter [@gbonfant](//twitter.com/gbonfant). Ocassionaly, I also push some frontend experiments to [codepen](//codepen.io/gus/).
