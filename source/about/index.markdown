Hi, I'm Gus. I'm a Software Engineer with an unusual interest in design, human behavior and human-computer interaction. With an almost obsessive need for devouring information I strive to be a quick learner.

I believe in fully dedicated oneself in order to achieve any level of success. You can follow me on twitter [@gbonfant](//twitter.com/gbonfant).
