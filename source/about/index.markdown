Hi, I'm Gus.

I'm a Software Engineer with an unusual interest in design, human behavior, human-computer interaction, and an almost obsessive need of devouring information.

I believe in fully dedicated oneself in order to achieve any level of success. You can view the [photos](//flickr.com/gbonfant) I've taken, fork my [code](//github.com/gbonfant), or follow me on twitter [@gbonfant](//twitter.com/gbonfant). Occasionally, I publish some of my front-end experiments to [codepen](//codepen.io/gus/).
